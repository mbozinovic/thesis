**Speaker notes:** To start off, there are three subjects/concepts/topics I'd like to be familiar with that will provide context to research. The first is the notion of a soundscape, or the total collection of sounds in an environment. This can be likened to a landscape that encompasses all visual features in an area. In the ocean, sounds comes from a variety of sources including human, biotic, and abiotic.

Human activities such as shipping, offshore wind farms, and mining are expected to increase, and so are sound levels as a result. The noise from these activities may overlap and interfere with marine ecosystems.

Soundscape research is expanding and its metrics can serve as an important measure of ocean ecosystem health.

## Introduction and Background

1.  Beaked whales

::: notes
Speaker notes: My research looks at the distributions several species of beaked whales within the family Ziphiidae and the sperm whale. These are particularly challenging animals to study for several reasons. Their long dive times and short surface intervals, coupled with a low-profile body, make them visually cryptic on the surface. What is known is that they are sensitive to human noise, especially that produced by navy sonar and shipping vessels. As an animal reliant on sound for communication and foraging, the acoustic interference of such basic life functions can lead to serious harm.

## Introduction and Background

Drifting buoys and PAM

!\[\](images/soundscapes.png)

::: notes
add notes here: Low sightings mean inadequate . PAM is a way to listen to the soundscape but also these whales that vocalize in distinct clicks. This is an acoustic drifitng buoy that is deployed for days or weeks at a time. It allows us to capture the dynamic nature of sound over a large spatial area. not influenced by survey vessel noise.

## Introduction and Background

2.  Theoretical framework and literature review

    -   Framework: Exploratory framework

    -   Lit review:

        -   More noise/increased shipping is expected.

        -   Beaked/sperm whale detections are difficult to collect, presence-only

        -   Soundscape research is on the rise, acoustic habitat is an parameter to consider in conservation/protected habitat management applications

3.  Specific research objectives.

    -   Characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of BW detections in relation to habitat, sound, vessels.

    -   Explore 2018 dataset from CCES survey with soundscape metrics and beaked whale detections.

        -   spatial proximity of vessels with high intensity sound events

## Methods

2.  Detailed description of methods to resolve research objectives

    -   Data collection

        -   

    -   Environmental variables

        -   

    -   GAM (or other) model

    -   ::: notes
        During a 2018 survey of the California Current Ecosystem with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Southwest Fisheries Science Center, twenty-two drifting buoys were deployed and recovered to listen to the soundscape in offshore locations. These buoys collected beaked and sperm whale echolocation pulses, GPS locations, and ambient sound levels.

## Methods

1.  List of environmental variables (fixed and dynamic)
    -   Bottom depth

    -   Bottom slope

    -   SSH

    -   distance to slope

    -   distance to land

    -   chlorophyll

    -   salinity

    -   SST

    -   Thermocline depth

## Projected Results

1.  What kind of info will this design acquire?
2.  How will you use this info to reach objectives?
