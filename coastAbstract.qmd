### Problem Statement

##### Why do we care about the problem? What scientific gap is your research filling?

\[Intro to PAM\]

\[Soundscapes and beaked/sperm whales\]

The ocean is becoming noisier with increased shipping and offshore human activity. Beaked whales and sperm whales are among the species at risk of harm from noise pollution, but they are rarely sighted, making the information about them/this effect on them limited. They rely on acoustic signaling for communication and foraging, but the extent of soundscapes is unknown. These whales are either vulnerable or endangered, but all are federally protected. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a non-invasive tool to provide insight into the acoustic environment of these rarely-seen species and fill gaps that fall short with other data collection methods.

### Methods and Approach

##### What did you actually do to get your results?

\[Drifting recorders are a tool with spatial and temporal movement.\]

X drifting recorders were deployed as part of CCES in summer of 2018. These contained GPS trackers, hydrophones, etc and collected a total of x hours of data. SWFSC ran acoustic detections in PAMGuard. Soundscape metrics overlaid on drift tracks in relation to various beaked whale and sperm whale detections. I will be investigating power spectral density, broadband levels, octave band levels, and third octave band levels.
